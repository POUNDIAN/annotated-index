Digitising The Annotated Index to The Cantos by Edwards and Vasse

## Creation

The raw text was generated by Amazon Textract (OCR); the photos were provided by physically photographing a copy of the Annotated Index. (?)

The raw was first formatted into JSON by ChatGPT. Note that ChatGPT introduced some details omitted by Edwards and Vasse. For example, the entry "Cuba" has canto & page numbers, but no detail. ChatGPT decided to provide some detail itself: "Island country in the Caribbean."

## API and Database

The goal here is to provide a database and API which can provide all references in the Annotated Index concerning any given Canto. We also want to be able to look up reference and discover where it is referenced in The Cantos.

## Manipulations

We will have to manipulate the data somewhat. Where the An.Index provides page number, we want to provide line number(s).

The An.Index uses capitalised words in the detail to suggest another entry. We want to be able to connect these entries somehow.

The An.Index uses square bracketted terms to denote that they actually donâ€™t appear in a Canto, but might be a fundamental reference of another entry in a Canto. (Check the An.Index preface for this.)

## Errors

There are some flaws in the Textract output and the data will need cleaning at some point. One common example is the substitution of '1' for 'i' or 'I'.
